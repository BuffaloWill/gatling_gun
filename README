gaitling_gun is a very basic script for creating SSH reverse proxies in the Amazon EC2 cloud and then using those as SOCKS proxies. The idea is similar to privoxy. Basically you spin up a bunch of instances and gaitling_gun will take care of the work of creating the reverse proxies to these systems and opening a single localhost listener to point your tool(s) at. Requests are then randomly distributed between the multiple remote systems therefore making it more cumbersome to block your source IP address.

Very useful for avoiding IP blockage during a pen test. 

Prerequisites:
# apt-get install ec2-api-tools
# gem install aws

ec2-api-tools utility (though not required if you've already created your own SOCKS proxies)
AWS gem
Add your EC2 information to the script, it should be obvious

Example Usage:
---> I have already spun up instances in the EC2 cloud and I would like gatling_gun to create the reverse proxies to these systems and create a local listener.
$ gaitling_gun.rb 
starting listening port on 127.0.0.1:60000

---> I have already created SOCKS proxies to any set of systems; ignore ec2 and just create the local listener and randomly distribute my traffic between my SOCKS proxies. I have set the 2 listeners on 60001 and 60002.
$ gaitling_gun.rb -f 2
starting listening port on 127.0.0.1:60000
