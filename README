gaitling_gun is a very basic script for creating SSH reverse proxies in the Amazon EC2 cloud and then using those as SOCKS proxies. The idea is similar to privoxy. Basically you spin up a bunch of instances and gaitling_gun will take care of the work of creating the reverse proxies to these systems and opening a single localhost listener to point your tool at. Requests are then randomly distributed between the multiple SOCKS proxies.

Very useful for avoiding IP blockage during a pen test. 

Prerequisites:
ec2-tools utility (though not required if you've already created your own SOCKS proxies)


Example Usage:
---> I have already spun up instances in the EC2 cloud and I would like gatling_gun to create the reverse proxies to these systems and create a local listener. I should've already spun up the instances.
$ gaitling_gun.rb 
starting listening port on 127.0.0.1:60000

---> I have already created SOCKS proxies to any set of systems. I have set the 2 listeners on 60001 and 60002.
$ gaitling_gun.rb -f 2
starting listening port on 127.0.0.1:60000
